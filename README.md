# ansiesc

This is a pathogen port of the AnsiEsc Vim plugin. found [here](http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=302)

Install by cloning the repo in your Vim bundle directory, like any random Pathogen plugin

Turn highlighting on with :AnsiEsc

I can't figure out what's the license on this thing.
